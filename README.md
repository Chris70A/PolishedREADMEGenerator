# PolishedREADMEGenerator


## Description


- I wanted to create a application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
- By creating a generator, you can save time and effort by automating the process of creating new Readme files.
- By using a Readme generator, you can ensure that your documentation is complete, accurate, and up-to-date. This can help users understand your project and avoid common pitfalls or issues.
- Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.
Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.
Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.
Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as let, const, and arrow functions.
Handle asynchronicity with callbacks and Promises.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To generate your own README, git clone the repo down to your local so you have the Node project on your local.

Run npm install in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the package.json:

- ***npm i inquirer@8.2.4***

The application will start by running node index.js in the command line.

Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.

After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'README.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.


## Usage

Once software is downloaded and Node packages are initialized, lets get started!

Within the directory for this project, initialize prompts using the command ***node index.js***

From there,  enter the necessary information for your project, and a new README.md file will be generated and placed into the ***Develop folder.***
